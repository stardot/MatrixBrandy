SYS calls in Matrix Brandy
==========================

A number of SYS calls are supported in Matrix Brandy, some of which are
emulations of the equivalent RISC OS SWIs.  Where a RISC OS SWI is emulated,
the SWI number used is the same as that used by RISC OS, in order to allow
code that uses the number rather than the name for performance reasons to run
correctly.

In this document, the parameters listed are labelled as ARM registers as
if the SWI were called in RISC OS.

Where a parameter returns a pointer to a string, it MUST be picked up with a
string variable; picking it up with a numeric variable and attempting to
access the buffer will not work.

OS_xxx
======
OS_WriteC		R0: Send (R0 AND &FF) to the VDU stream.
			Matrix Brandy extension:
			   If R1 and R2 are both set to 42, the character is
			   output to the controlling terminal on the stderr
			   stream.

OS_Write0:		R0: Pointer to NULL-terminated string, to be sent to
			    the VDU stream.
			Matrix Brandy extension:
			   If R1 and R2 are both set to 42, the string is
			   output to the controlling terminal on the stderr
			   stream.

OS_NewLine		Sends \r\n (&0D, &0A) to the VDU stream.

OS_ReadC		Reads a character from the keyboard, returned in R0.

OS_ReadLine and

OS_ReadLine32		Returns a string input from the keyboard, pointed in R0.

OS_Mouse		Returns mouse state.

OS_ReadModeVariable	Read a mode variable into R2.

OS_ReadVduVariables	Read VDU variables requested in block pointed in R0
			into block pointed in R1. R0 and R1 may point to the
			same block.

OS_ReadMonotonicTime	Return centisecond timer in R0.

OS_Plot			Executes a PLOT function. Note that this bypasses the
			VDU driver so plotting this way will not be picked up
			by *SPOOL.

OS_ScreenMode		Only R0=0,1,7,8,9,10 are supported.

OS_SWINumberFromString	Returns SWI number from name.
			On RISC OS this call is intercepted so we can also
			recognise Brandy-specific calls.

OS_WriteI block		(SWIs 256-511). Call by number.
			Matrix Brandy extension:
			   If R1 and R2 are both set to 42, the character is
			   output to the controlling terminal on the stderr
			   stream.

OS_Byte			R0, R1, R2 are A, X and Y.
			Calls the OSBYTE system call, see docs/osbyte.txt

OS_Word			R0 is A, R1 is the address of the data block.
			Only R0=9, 10, 139, 140 are supported.
			139 and 140 are specific to Matrix Brandy and
			BBCSDL. Details in docs/Mode7.txt

BRANDY-SPECIFIC CALLS
=====================
Brandy_xxx  (SWI numbers start &140000)

&140000 Brandy_Version		Returns:
				R0: Major version number
				R1: Minor version number
				R2: Patchlevel number
				R3: Git commit SHA (if available)
				R4: Pointer to host OS name string
				R5: 1 if SDL build, otherwise 0.
				R6: Returns a fixed 64-bit value:
				    &123456789ABCDEF0
				R7: 1 if 64-bit build, otherwise 0.

&140001 Brandy_Swap16Palette	Returns nothing.
				In 16-colour modes, as Flash isn't supported,
				this swaps the dimmed colours at 8-15 with the
				standard brightness at 0-7. Calling again
				switches back. Some other BBC BASIC versions
				use 0-7 as dimmed colours.

&140002 Brandy_GetVideoDriver	Returns:
				R0: Pointer to SDL video driver name string
				R1: Length of string in R0
				R2: Pointer to screen memory base
				R3: Size of screen memory.
				R4: Base of MODE 7 frame buffer
				R5: SDL surface handle (pointer)
				R6: Pointer to SDL_PixelFormat structure of
				    the display surface.

&140003 Brandy_SetFailoverMode	R0: Set mode to be selected should chosen screen
				    mode be unavailable (instead of returning
				    "Screen mode is unavailable). Set to 255 to
				    disable.

&140004 Brandy_AccessVideoRAM	If R0=0, return pixel value at pixel offset R1
				   into R2.
				If R0 non-zero, write R2 into pixel offset R1.
				R1 is pixel offset, so each step of 1 is the
				   next pixel irrespective of screen mode.
				Note this writes directly to the 24bpp frame
				buffer so bypasses any screen mode palette or
				colour depth limit. The top 8 bits, which are
				ignored by SDL, are used to carry the logical
				colour number in paletted modes to support
				VDU19 palette changing.

&140005 Brandy_INTusesFloat	This enables a BB4W/BBCSDL extension that allows
				INT() to handle numbers > 2^31-1 by using a
				float if the number is out of range for a 32-bit
				signed integer.
				R0=1 to enable, 0 to disable. Default: disabled.

&140006 Brandy_LegacyIntMaths	This allows integer mathematics to be handled in
				the way BBC BASIC 1 to 4 on the Acorn 8-bit
				machines, and RISC OS ARM BBC BASIC V,
				including the rather questionable wrap-around
				on integers. RISC OS ARM BBC BASIC VI, BB4W
				and BBCSDL do not have this wrap-around issue
				and will promote to float when needed.
				R0=1 to enable, 0 to disable. Default: disabled.

&140007 Brandy_Hex64		This controls whether Brandy renders and
				interprets Base 16 (Hexadecimal) values as
				64-bit.
				R0=1 to enable, 0 to disable. Default: disabled.

&140008 Brandy_DELisBS		Toggles whether the DEL key functions as
				backspace (DELETE in old BBC terminology).
				R0=1 to enable, 0 to disable.
				Default: Enabled on UNIX text-mode builds,
					 Disabled otherwise.

&140009 Brandy_PseudovarsUnsigned
				Only effective on 32-bit hardware. Toggles
				whether memory pseudo-variables (e.g. PAGE,
				HIMEM etc) return large positive numbers
				above &7FFFFFFF.
				R0=1 to enable, 0 to disable. Default: disabled.

&14000A Brandy_TekEnabled	Only effective on the 'tbrandy' build, ignored
				without error on other builds.
				This switch enables Tektronix graphics to
				be generated for graphics operations, with
				particular reference to the Tek emulation
				in xterm.
				R0=1 to enable, 0 to disable. Default: disabled
				R1=simulated baud rate, 0 to run at full speed.

&14000B Brandy_uSleep		Calls the OS function usleep(R0).

&14000C Brandy_dlopen		Calls the OS function dlopen(R0,RTLD_LAZY).
				Handle is returned in R0.

&14000D Brandy_dlcall		Locates the symbol in R0, and calls it with
				parameters from R1..R9.

&14000E Brandy_MAlloc		Allocates memory from system call malloc(R0).
				Pointer to base returned in R0.

&14000F Brandy_Free		Frees memory pointed to in R0 from earlier
				malloc. Nothing returned.

&140010 Brandy_BitShift64	This controls whether Brandy calculates bit
				shifts in 64-bit space. 32-bit space is used
				when disabled as per ARM BBC BASIC VI.
				R0=1 to enable, 0 to disable. Default: disabled.

&140011 Brandy_Platform		Similar to Brandy_Version, but more focused on
				the platform Brandy is running on.
				R0: Pointer to host OS name string
				R1: Pointer to CPU family string
				R2: 64-bit? (1 or 0)
				R3: SDL build? (1 or 0)
				R4: Machine type (as returned by OSBYTE 0)
				R5: "Legacy" INKEY-256 (e.g. &F9 for Linux)
				R6: The PID and PPID of the current process.
				    (formatted as PID + (PPID << 32))
				    Note: PPID not returned on Windows.

&140012 Brandy_RefreshInterval	Sets the SDL display refresh interval in
				centiseconds in R0. 0 means no refresh delays.
				Nothing is returned.

&140013 Brandy_MouseEventExpire	Sets the mouse event expiry time in
				centiseonds, 0 disables.
				With a zero event expiry time, a maximum
				event queue length is used (7 events) which
				mirrors RISC OS behaviour.


RaspberryPi_xxx (SWI numbers start &140100)
