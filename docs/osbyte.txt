OSBYTE and *FX calls
====================

Brandy implements a limited set of OSBYTE calls, either by *FX, CALL &FFF4,
result%=USR &FFF4, or SYS "OS_Byte",A[,X[,Y]] [TO ...]. Where a return value
is supported, it will be &00YYXXAA when called via USR &FFF4.

OSBYTE 176-255 read and write system variables with
    newvalue = (oldvalue AND Y) EOR X
so *FX a,x[,0] and OSBYTE A,X,0 writes the value and OSBYTE A,0,255 reads
the value. Different combinations of X and Y can set and reset individual
bits.


Supported OSBYTE calls
----------------------
A=0:    X=0:  return the MOS version as an error with ERR=247.
        X<>0: Return the host OS version in the X register (as per the 'use' doc)
A=6:    Sets the default printer ignore character, default is 13.
A=20:   Resets the system font (SDL build only)
A=25:   Resets parts of the system font (SDL build only)
        X=0 or 16 resets the teletext font (16 ONLY does the teletext font)
        after being changed with OSWORD 140.
A=42:   (Deprecated, see A=163 X=2)
A=43:   (Deprecated, see A=163 X=3)
A=44:   (Deprecated, see A=163 X=4)

A=106:  Select mouse pointer. Due to SDL limitations, this simply turns the
        pointer on or off, and unlinking does nothing.
A=112:  Selects which video bank the VDU drivers access. 4 available.
A=113:  Selects which video bank is drawn to the display window.
A=128:  ADVAL. As with BASIC ADVAL, only some subfuntions supported.
A=129:  INKEY. As with BASIC INKEY, scanning for range of keys not supported.
A=130:  High word of user memory.
A=131:  Bottom of user memory.
A=132:  Top of user memory
A=134:  Return text cursor position in X and Y. Identical to 165.
A=135:  Return screen mode and character under cursor or 0 if unreadable.
A=160:  Read VDU variable (equivalent to VDU(X%))
A=163:  Application Support - X < 128 are local to Brandy
        X=1: Get or set refresh state (as per *REFRESH)
                Y=0: Equivalent to *REFRESH OFF
                Y=1: Equivalent to *REFRESH ON
                Y=2: Equivalent to *REFRESH ONERROR
                Y=255: Query the state, will return 0, 1 or 2 in Y register.
        X=2: Get or set various states [Brandy only]
                If NO bits set: return state in Y register.
                If ALL bits set: Analogue of Linux's "stty sane" - enables 
                    Refresh, issues a VDU 6 and sets both video bank controls
                    to 0.
                Bits 0 and 1 control or contain the *REFRESH state:
                  00: No operation.
                  01: Set with *REFRESH OFF
                  10: Set with *REFRESH ON
                  11: Set with *REFRESH ONERROR
                  Returned values: 01, 10 or 11.
                Bits 2 and 3 control or contain the Full Screen state:
                  00: No operation.
                  01: Full Screen Off.
                  10: Full Screen On.
                  11: Full Screen Toggle.
                  Returned values: 00 (off) or 10 (on).
                Bit 4: If set, do immediate display refresh, equivalent
                  to *REFRESH
                  Value not returned.
        X=3:    Perform a VDU X to the controlling Linux terminal.
        X=4:    Y=1: CTRL-N and CTRL-P do line editing (default).
                Y=0: CTRL-N and CTRL-P just send their codes.
                        Arrow keys still do line editing.
        X=127: Analogue of Linux's "stty sane" - enables Refresh, issues a
               VDU 6 and sets both video bank controls to 0.
        X=242: Set the line drawing dot pattern style
A=165:  Return text cursor position in X and Y. Identical to 134.

A=200:  Set Escape key and Reset effects - only Escape key effect supported.
A=210:  Sound disabled if X is non-zero.
A=220:  Set TAB character
A=220:  Set ESCAPE character
A=229:  Enable or disable ESCAPE, disabled if X non-zero.
A=230:  Define Escape effects.
A=250:  Read and write video bank set with OSBYTE 112, returns bank set with
        OSBYTE 113 in Y
A=251:  Read and write video bank set with OSBYTE 113.

OSBYTEs 166-255 read and write OSBYTE system variables with new=(old AND Y) EOR X,
but only those listed have any effect.

The difference between *FX229 and *FX200 is that *FX229,1 results in the Escape
key returning an ASCII character, and *FX200,1 results in the Escape key not
generating an Escape state.

Escape handler generates an "Escape" error. The error handler then calls the
EscapeAcknowledge code called by OSBYTE 126. This examines OSBYTE 230 to
determine what to do. bit0-bit3 indicate what to do after an Escape, bit4-bit7
indicate that these actions should be done for all errors, not just Escapes.
The default is &00 to do all Escape actions on Escape only.

bit 0=0: close Exec, cancel VDU queue, clear sounds, cancel pending keypresses
bit 1=0: refresh display
bit 2=0: reserved
bit 3=0: reserved
bit 4=1: clear Exec/VDU/Sound/keyboard on errors
bit 5=1: refresh display on errors
bit 6=1: reserved
bit 7=1: reserved
