Brandy implements Basic VI, the the 64-bit floating-point mathematics
variant of the dialect of Basic that Acorn Computers supplied with their
ranges of desktop computers that use the ARM processor such as the Archimedes
and RiscPC. Basic V and VI are an extended version of BBC Basic. This was the
Basic used on the BBC Micro that Acorn made during the early 1980s.

There is some very useful documentation for the BBC Micro
available on the Internet. One very good site is 'The BBC Lives!'

The best manual to look at is the BBC User's Guide. It is useful
in that it gives a lot of background information on BBC Basic and
the environment in which it runs. It should help in understanding
this interpreter better.
