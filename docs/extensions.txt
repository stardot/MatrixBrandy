&o                      - octal constant, eg &o107
%                       - binary constant, eg %100111 (standard extension)
%%                      - Variable suffix, to denote a 64-bit integer.
&                       - Variable suffix, to denote unsigned 8-bit integer.
]                       - 64-bit unary indirection.

DIM HIMEM               - A Basalt extension, use to define arrays outside
                          of heap space using malloc(). Byte arrays defined
                          this way can be de-allocated by re-DIMming to -1.

CLEAR HIMEM [<array()>] - Deallocate off-heap arrays allocated using DIM HIMEM.
                          This does not deallocate memory blocks.


Notes on ADVAL(-1) and EOF#0
----------------------------
ADVAL(-1) returns how many entries are in the keyboard buffer, EOF#0 - where implemented - returns
whether the next GET or INKEY will return immediately. These are two slightly different concepts.

If the current input stream is an EXEC file, ADVAL(-1) does not tell you if tell you if there
is a byte to read from GET/INKEY.

If the current input stream is the serial port, ADVAL(-1) does not tell you if there is a byte
to read from GET/INKEY, the serial input buffer is ADVAL(-2).

Subtly, soft keys can give unexpected results. Consider the case where you have:
*KEY 0 "hello"
*KEY 1 ""

Assuming the keyboard buffer is empty, if f0 is pressed, ADVAL(-1) will return 1. GET/INKEY will
fetch the "h" character, but thereup ADVAL(-1) will return 0 - as there is now nothing in the
keyboard buffer. However, there are still four characters that can be fetched as there is a
soft key being expanded. You can see this with this bit of code, press f0 and only a single
character will be displayed:

REPEAT
  IF ADVAL(-1) THEN VDU GET
UNTIL FALSE

Now assume that f1 has been pressed. ADVAL(-1) will again return 1 as there is one entry in the
keyboard buffer. However, GET will wait forever, as it will fetch the one entry from the
keyboard buffer, find it is a soft key, find that the soft key defintion is a null string, and
loop back waiting for something to enter the keyboard buffer. Again, with the same sample code,
pressing f1 will cause the program to wait forever - or until another key is pressed.


If EOF#0 is implemented, it should do its best to examine the system and only return zero if
and only if the next GET/INKEY will immediately return with no waiting, so the following code
will work:

REPEAT
  IF NOT EOF#0 THEN VDU GET
UNTIL FALSE

In general, if you can it is better to write code in the form:

key%=INKEY(time):IF key%<>-1 THEN ....
